one or more markets from time to time due to various factors, especially after periods of high growth, such as we have 
experienced. For example, although we saw increased growth in our user base during the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced 
lower levels of DAUq growth and declining DAUq as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic subsided. DAUq has also 
declined in the past in periods following usage peaks surrounding certain worldwide events, such as the onset of the conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine in the three months ended March 31, 2022, and cultural trends, including video game releases, 
such as Elden Ring in the three months ended March 31, 2022, and traffic related to r/ wallstreetbets in the three months ended 
March 31, 2021. These usage peaks are driven by external factors that are outside of our control. Accordingly, such growth may 
not be repeatable and we may experience declines in DAUq in the future in similar circumstances. DAUq has also been volatile 
during community responses to domestic and international social unrest as well as in response to actions by us. For example, we 
saw increased growth in our user base in the three months ended December 31, 2023, which may have been driven in part by 
performance improvements in our product and possibly by migration of usage from certain third-party applications in response 
to changes in our application program interface (“API”) terms and policies. Such growth may not be sustainable. In the three 
months ended December 31, 2024, logged-out DAUq comprised 55% of global DAUq. Logged-out users typically come to 
Reddit via search engines, spend less time on the site, and do not monetize at the same rate as logged-in users. Furthermore, we 
anticipate that our DAUq growth rate will slow over time as the absolute number of our DAUq increases. To the extent our 
DAUq growth rate slows or becomes negative, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to increase levels of 
engagement and monetization on our platform, including the level at which users visiting us from search traffic become more 
frequent users of our platform. 
A number of factors could harm Redditor growth and engagement or impact our ability to compete effectively, including if:
•
Redditors engage with other products, services, or activities as an alternative to ours;
•
our competitors incorporate features into their products that are substantially similar to ours or improve upon such 
features when including them in their products;
•
we fail to introduce new and improved products or services or we introduce new or improved products or services that 
negatively affect Redditor engagement;
•
we are unable to convert DAUq who come to our platform through internet search engines to sign-up and log in;
•
Redditors feel that their Reddit experience is diminished as a result of our decisions with respect to the frequency, 
prominence, and size of ads that we display, or the quality of the ads displayed;
•
influential Redditors or certain demographics of Redditors conclude that an alternative product or service better meets 
their needs;
•
we are unable to convince new Redditors of the value and usefulness of our products and services;
•
technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products or services in a rapid and reliable manner or 
otherwise negatively affect Redditors’ experience with our platform;
•
we fail to effectively adopt new technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (“AI”), that our 
competitors may have more experience utilizing and leveraging in their products and services; 
•
Redditors have difficulty installing, updating, searching, or otherwise accessing our products and content or prefer to 
utilize third-party applications that have shut down or no longer integrate with our platform;
•
there are disruptions to the normal operation of our communities, including as a result of actions or inactions by our

Additionally, a decrease in the 2024 U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction 
contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate. These factors were partially offset by an increase in stock-based 
compensation-related tax benefits in 2024.
The OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus 
around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax 
rate of 15%. Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect others 
to follow, however this did not have a material effect on our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. 
Financial Condition
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
As of December 31, 2024, we had $95.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. 
Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid 
government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity 
securities.
Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow 
that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the 
business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to 
stockholders.
The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):

(79,733) 
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other 
properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash through 
consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app purchases, and devices. In Google Cloud, we generate cash 
through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud services.
Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, 
to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include 
payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2023 to 2024 due to an increase in cash received from 
customers, partially offset by an increase in cash payments for cost of revenues and operating expenses.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and 
non-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-
marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.
Net cash used in investing activities increased from 2023 to 2024 primarily due to an increase in purchases of 
property and equipment and purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of 
marketable securities. The increase in purchases of property and equipment is primarily driven by investments in 
technical infrastructure. 
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the 
sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, 
net payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt.
Net cash used in financing activities increased from 2023 to 2024 due to dividend payments and net payments 
related to stock-based award activities, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of 
repayments.

We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, VPs, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and
our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.
We aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between
cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We
conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid
based on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to
rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.
We care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health
benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a
way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match
for charitable donations.
We believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.

In addition, workarounds or other mitigation efforts in certain instances have not been, and in 
the future may not be, available or sufficient to protect customers prior to a security update being made available. 
Vulnerabilities can persist even after we have issued security updates if we have not identified and addressed the root cause of a 
particular vulnerability, if customers have not installed the most recent updates, if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities 
before a security update is applied to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems, or if a previously 
patched vulnerability is inadvertently reintroduced due to a security regression during future development. Additionally, 
customers may also need to test security updates before they can be deployed which can delay implementation. When 
customers do not deploy security updates in a timely manner, use solutions that are end of life and no longer receive security 
updates, or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our solutions containing the security update, they are left vulnerable. 
In addition, we rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based services on which our and third-party data is stored or 
processed, and we cannot control the timing at which third-party providers remedy vulnerabilities, which could leave us 
vulnerable. Failure to comply with internal security policies and standards, including secure development lifecycle practices,
